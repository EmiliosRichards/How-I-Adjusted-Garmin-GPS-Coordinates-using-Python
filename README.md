# XML-Workout-Data-GPS-Interpolation

Welcome! This document contains details of a small project. Find out how I used Python to solve an issue related to my Gamrin Multisport GPS Watch and how the implications of the Isreal-Palistine conflict incentivised some deeper learning of 3 Python Libraries.

# Introduction 

To provide some context, since a child I've relished in a variety of sports and as I've grown into a young adult -- maintained a keen interest in fitnees!!! 


My most recent focus is an exercise that some may see as burdensome, albeit challenging at times I see it as an escape from the hustle and bustle of life, its a simple workout that I can only regard as a classic, that is, the art of running. It's a form birthed at childhood that we all know too well, its beauty lays in its simplicity and due to it being one of our most natural movements, it's needless to say running is one of the best investments for your mind and body. As with most of my hobbies, I found great joy in quantifying my progress and seeking ways to improve my ability level. Heartrate and Distance were metrics I soon began to observe. By utilising Garmin's Fenix Multisport GPS watch and their accompanying platform Garmin Connect, I have been able to . The Fenix encompasses a broad range of features and capabilities, including Heart-Rate Monitoring, GPS tracking, and . through Garmin connect, workout data - Mapping the rounts taken during a run.

It is a great watch, and I love the design and features it provides, it has accomplished everything 

with one major exception, the GPS produced perculiar results. It will come at no shock to those who have travelled through the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Middle-Eastern regions that it is no fault of brand or model. The problem I faced stems from a much deeper issue: electronic warfare and our spatial proximity to the Middle-Eastern region. The geopolitical conflict in this area has resulted in GPS and satellite signal disruptions.

Due to the incorrect coordinates -- essentially going haywire -- this had serveral implications; First, an inaccuracy of distance, : Example meant that a 10k run may show up as 7k or at times even 0.7k. Second --

As it turns out, the workout data could be remidiated by accessing and adapting the corresponding TCX - Training Center XML - file. My goal was simple,
